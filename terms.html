        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white">Nature of the Service</span><br/>
          drivingLynX is a technology platform that serves as a broker and marketplace. We connect independent, licensed drivers (“Instructors”) with individuals seeking driving practice (“Students”).<br/>
          <span class="text-gray-400">Not a Driving School:</span> drivingLynX is not a driving school, does not provide driving instruction, and does not employ instructors.<br/>
          <span class="text-gray-400">Intermediary Role:</span> Our role is strictly limited to facilitating the connection, scheduling, and processing of payments between users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white">No Insurance Coverage Provided</span><br/>
          IMPORTANT: drivingLynX does not provide any insurance coverage (including but not limited to auto liability, general liability, or professional liability) for Students or Instructors.<br/>
          <span class="text-gray-400">User Responsibility:</span> It is the sole responsibility of the Instructor and/or the vehicle owner to ensure they have valid, adequate insurance that covers “for‑hire” instruction or business use of the vehicle.<br/>
          <span class="text-gray-400">Student Responsibility:</span> Students agree that they are participating at their own risk. drivingLynX is not liable for any damages, injuries, or claims arising from lessons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white">Instructor Requirements & Representations</span><br/>
          By using this platform as an Instructor, you represent and warrant that:
          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>You hold a valid, current Driver’s License in your jurisdiction.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for complying with all local and state laws regarding private driving instruction.</li>
            <li>You acknowledge that drivingLynX does not verify your instructional pedagogy or “teaching” experience; we only verify your identity and basic license status.</li>
            <li>You are an Independent Contractor, not an employee of drivingLynX. You set your own availability and may accept or reject requests at your discretion.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white">Scheduling and Payments</span><br/>
          <span class="text-gray-400">Booking:</span> A contract for services is formed directly between the Student and the Instructor when an Instructor accepts a Student’s time request.<br/>
          <span class="text-gray-400">Escrow/Payment:</span> drivingLynX acts as a limited payment collection agent. The Student pays at the time of booking or completion (as specified), and funds are held until the service is marked as provided.<br/>
          <span class="text-gray-400">Service Fees:</span> drivingLynX may charge a service fee for facilitating the transaction, which will be disclosed at the time of payment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white">Limitation of Liability</span><br/>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, drivingLynX shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to:
          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Physical injury or property damage occurring during a driving session.</li>
            <li>The conduct (online or offline) of any Student or Instructor.</li>
            <li>Any traffic violations or legal penalties incurred during the use of the service.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white">Background Checks and Vetting</span><br/>
          While drivingLynX may perform basic identity verification, we do not guarantee the skill, character, or safety of any user. Users are encouraged to exercise caution and perform their own due diligence before meeting in person.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white">Termination</span><br/>
          We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any account that violates these terms, receives repeated safety complaints, or operates in a manner that creates legal risk for the platform.
        </li>
      </ol>
