        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white text-base">Nature of the Service & Provider Tiers</span><br/>
          drivingLynX is a technology marketplace connecting individuals seeking driving practice or test transportation (“Students”) with independent service providers (“Providers”). drivingLynX is not a driving school, transportation network company, or employer. We facilitate connections across two distinct tiers:
          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1 text-gray-400">
            <li><strong class="text-gray-200">Certified Mentors:</strong> Licensed driving instructors offering formal instructional services (with or without a vehicle).</li>
            <li><strong class="text-gray-200">Transit Drivers:</strong> Fully licensed drivers offering a "Take me to driving test" service (transporting the Student to the test location, waiting, and returning). Transit Drivers are strictly prohibited from offering driving instruction.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white text-base">Strict Onboarding & Certification Requirements</span><br/>
          To utilize the platform and set up payment processing, Providers must meet strict criteria:
          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1 text-gray-400">
            <li><strong class="text-gray-200">Mentors:</strong> Must digitally certify and provide proof of active affiliation with a state-licensed driving school, possess valid instructor credentials, and attest to having a minimum of 1,000 hours of instructional experience.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-gray-200">Transit Drivers:</strong> Must hold a valid, unrestricted US Driver's License and comply with all state-specific livery, rideshare, or "for-hire" transportation regulations.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white text-base">Insurance Disclaimers & "For-Hire" Exclusions</span><br/>
          <strong class="text-red-400 uppercase">Important: drivingLynX provides absolutely no insurance coverage.</strong><br/>
          <span class="text-gray-400">Personal auto insurance policies typically contain a "livery exclusion," meaning coverage is voided if the vehicle is used to transport passengers for a fee.</span><br/>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1 text-gray-400">
            <li><strong class="text-gray-200">Provider Responsibility:</strong> Mentors and Transit Drivers are solely responsible for maintaining commercial auto insurance, driving school insurance, or Transportation Network Company (TNC) endorsements that legally cover "for-hire" activities and third-party instruction.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-gray-200">Student Responsibility:</strong> Students agree they enter vehicles at their own risk and waive all right to claim damages against drivingLynX for auto accidents, injuries, or property damage.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white text-base">Payments, Escrow, and Booking Fees</span><br/>
          drivingLynX acts as a limited payment collection agent.<br/>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1 text-gray-400">
            <li><strong class="text-gray-200">Rates:</strong> Providers set their own hourly rates for Instructional Services or Test Transit Services.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-gray-200">Booking Fee:</strong> drivingLynX applies a platform booking fee to each transaction, disclosed to the Student at checkout, to maintain the technology infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong class="text-gray-200">Escrow:</strong> Funds are collected from the Student at the time of booking and held in escrow. Funds are disbursed to the Provider only after the service is marked as successfully completed by both parties.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold text-white text-base">Limitation of Liability & Indemnification</span><br/>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, drivingLynX shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Providers and Students agree to indemnify and hold drivingLynX harmless from any claims, legal penalties, traffic violations, or accidents arising from the use of the platform. We do not guarantee the skill, safety, or legal compliance of any user.
        </li>
      </ol>
